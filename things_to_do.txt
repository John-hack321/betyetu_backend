short but lazy things that i need to do before i forget:
    learn and find out if im doing error handling the right way 

big things that need to be done 

code red things that need critical fixing 
    fix the database alembic versioning issues with regards to Stake model and other modles soon to come (veryy urgent)
    optimize the stakes endpoint to make it more time effeicient and less resource intensive








// this completed things list will be put here as a way of showing myslef that im making progress
completed stuff : 

1. on the fetch_user_profile_data , make it match the frontend by not sending the email as part of the response
2. find a way for returning the time the db_object was created at well ( either craate a new column for data of creation of rind a way to use the already created_at column already present)
3. find a way to sort the stakes data before sending back to the frontend
