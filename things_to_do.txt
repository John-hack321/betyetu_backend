short but lazy things that i need to do before i forget:
    find a way to make sure that the possible win calculation always returns whole numbers only and not decimals in their returns
    create an ended fixture pydantic modelf for handling the ended match logic
    confirm if i need to make the match service instace global like the polling service so that i dont have to call it each time in a different place
    confirm if i have done the db_dependancy thing well

big things that need to be done 
    make it so that both users have to place the same stake amount for it all to work
    need to understane the inner working of alembic so that i avoid falling into alembic pitfalls and all
    optimize the stakes endpoint to make it more time effeicient and less resource intensive

code red things that need critical fixing or doing:
    find a way to implement atomicity on alot of processes
    solve the stake data processing service issue  of returning all matches as lost even the ones that haven't been played yet
    find a way to send the ended match data to the frontend well with respect to redis
    find a way to remove the ended matches from redis


big things but for later on
    make the fixtures and league data to include even the season data (eg. 2024/2025 season shit)
    since im still in the dev phase, write a function/ endpoint that does outcome cleanup by checking for all of the matches that hve been played yet they havent been flagged as expired and make the expire once and for all 








// this completed things list will be put here as a way of showing myslef that im making progress
completed stuff : 

1. on the fetch_user_profile_data , make it match the frontend by not sending the email as part of the response
2. find a way for returning the time the db_object was created at well ( either craate a new column for data of creation of rind a way to use the already created_at column already present)
3. find a way to sort the stakes data before sending back to the frontend
4. fix the database alembic versioning issues with regards to Stake model and other modles soon to come (veryy urgent)
3. start using redis on the match processing function in live data services
4. learn and find out if im doing error handling the right way
5. find a way to prevent the stake owner from being the stake guest
